This is a Fan-made unofficial session viewer for the fitness game 'Shardfall' by QUELL.

This currently works but in the future this is subject to change due to encryption of data or additional development.

Currently only works with a Mac or Windows standalone application (can be found in the builds folder) alternatively you can build from Unity Directly.

Currently finds all users session data from its save folder.
